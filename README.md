## :dart: About ##


Flashcard application for studying, allowing users to create, list, edit, delete, and review flashcards.
The project is split into backend (PHP + SQLite) and frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind), running with Docker Compose.
## :sparkles: Features ##

:heavy_check_mark: Create (front, back, color);\
:heavy_check_mark: List all;\
:heavy_check_mark: Edit and delete;\
:heavy_check_mark: Review flashcards ;


## :memo: Architectural Decisions: 
The backend was intentionally developed without relying on a heavy framework. At first, I considered using PHP Slim, but given its obsolescence, I decided to build the backend in pure PHP to keep it lightweight and maintain full control, while focusing more effort on the frontend.

For the UI, I chose TailwindCSS instead of Bootstrap. Tailwind provides greater flexibility, a modern utility-first approach, and allowed me to sharpen my skills with a framework that is more widely adopted in recent projects.

Data persistence is handled with SQLite, a lightweight relational database, accessed through PDO for simplicity and portability.

For testing, I integrated PHPUnit, a familiar tool that provides reliable unit testing for the PHP ecosystem.

The project is structured into clear and maintainable modules:

Backend

- backend/cli/cli.php – command line interface
- backend/src/Models/ – data models
- backend/src/Database/ – database connection
- backend/src/Router/ – request routing
- backend/tests/ – unit tests

Frontend

- src/api.ts – API integration
- src/App.tsx – main application component
- src/index.css – global styles
- src/main.tsx – React entry point
- src/components/ – reusable UI components

Both backend and frontend include their own Dockerfiles, ensuring environment consistency and smooth setup.


## API Endpoints
GET /flashcards → list all
GET /flashcards/review → return one flashcard
POST /flashcards → create ({ front, back, color })
PUT /flashcards/{id} → update
DELETE /flashcards/{id} → delete

## Layout

## Run all tests:

```bash
docker exec -it flashcard-backend phpunit tests --testdox
```
## Run a specific test:

```bash
docker exec -it flashcard-backend phpunit tests/FlashcardTest.php --filter testCreateFlashcard --testdox
```

## CLI

```bash
docker exec -it flashcard-backend php cli/cli.php 
- list
- create
- update <id>
- delete <id>
```

## :white_check_mark: Requirements ##

Before starting :checkered_flag:, you need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

## :checkered_flag: Starting ##

```bash

# Clone this project
$ git clone https://github.com/edunavarro17/flashcard.git

# Access
$ cd flashcard

# Run the project
$ docker-compose up --build

# The server will initialize in the 
Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Backend API: http://localhost:8080
```
## Future Work:
- Authentication
- Organize per category of the card
- Optional include an image in the front or back
- Feature to create a game of cards per user
- Integrate to AI to autogenerated per topic
